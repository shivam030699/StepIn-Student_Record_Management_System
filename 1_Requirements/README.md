# REQUIREMENTS AND INTRODUCTION FOR STUDENT RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
# Introduction to STUDENT RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Student records are often viewed as paperwork produced for the education bureaucracy. However, a well-designed student record system, whether using paper documents or automated systems, yields many benefits. The most important of these is the ability to report information for decision making about individual students, schools, programs, and school districts. A second benefit, particularly with automated systems, is efficiency in processing and exchanging student records among schools. When student records are added to an overall management information system that includes information on staff, materials, and budgeting for the school or school district, more management activities can be accomplished and efficiency will be improved. Student record systems, thus, play a key role in the overall functioning of the education system; but more importantly, they increase a school's ability to meet the needs of students.

weaknesses are activities that an enterprise does not perform very well or resources that are used irrationally.
feasibilities are alternatives that an enterprise can use to achieve strategic goals.

# Requirements (High level and Low level)
High-level and low-level, as technical terms, are used to classify, describe and point to specific goals of a systematic operation; and are applied in a wide range of contexts, such as, for instance, in domains as widely varied as computer science and business administration. High-level describe those operations that are more abstract in nature; wherein the overall goals and systemic features are typically more concerned with the wider, macro system as a whole. Low-level describes more specific
